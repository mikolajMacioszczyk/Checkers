# Checkers Project README

## Project Description

The "Checkers" project is a comprehensive checkers application consisting of two components: a desktop application built using WPF on the .NET platform and a console application, also built on the .NET platform. The desktop application allows you to play checkers against a computer opponent that uses an algorithm based on the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning. The console application is primarily used for testing the algorithm's performance and strength.

## Requirements

1. .NET 6 platform installed

## Running the Desktop Application

To run the desktop application, follow these steps:

1. Open the "Checkers" project in IDE.

2. Choose the "DesktopCheckers" project as the startup project.

3. Run the project.

After these steps, the desktop application will launch, allowing you to play a game of checkers against a computer opponent that uses the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning. You can follow the game's progress on the screen with the presented screenshots (on the bottom).

## Running the Console Application

The console application is mainly used for testing the algorithm's performance. To run it, follow these steps:

1. Open the "ConsoleCheckers" project in Visual.

2. Choose the "ConsoleCheckers" project as the startup project.

3. Run the project.

The console application allows you to test the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for various game situations. Test results can be collected and analyzed to evaluate the algorithm's performance.

## Additional Information

- The Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning efficiently handles searching up to 7 moves ahead in the game space.

- The desktop application enables interactive gameplay against a computer opponent.

Thank you for using our "Checkers" application! We hope you enjoy playing checkers and testing the algorithm using the console application.
